      "job_description": "Company description:\nBlock Party is a seed-stage tech startup building powerful consumer tools for online safety and privacy. People described our flagship product for Twitter as “​​bloody marvellous”, “the only thing that makes [Twitter] bearable”, and “v good app 10/10 much recommend”. And although it’s only in Alpha, our new product, Privacy Party, rates as “magical”,“really f****** cool!”, and “an essential extension if you access any social media sites”.\n\nWe’re a team of Stanford, Harvard, Yale, and MIT alums led by founder and CEO Tracy Chou (early engineer at Pinterest, Quora, and Facebook; 2022 Time Woman of the Year; Forbes 30 under 30) and backed by world class investors like Precursor and Stellation. More about us on the company website.\n\nStart date:\nImmediate\n\nLocation:\nUS; this is a remote role on a distributed team (core working hours are midday Eastern Time)\n\nWhat you’ll do:\nYou’ll be one of the first engineers on the team and help bring our first product to market. You’ll work closely with the (technical) CEO and teammates on engineering, design, growth and go-to-market to prioritize the product and tech roadmap; you’ll also be a critical part of the engineering team responsible for building and shipping. As an early member of the engineering team, you’ll shape the foundations of Block Party engineering, not just in terms of the technology but also the culture and processes.\n\nWhat we’re looking for:\n• A full-stack or back-end builder with 2+ years of relevant industry experience\n• A product-first engineer able to work cross-functionally with design, growth, and go-to-market\n• A clear, friendly, open-minded communicator who provides and incorporates feedback\n• A strategic thinker who can plan & reason about product, technology, processes, and people\n• Ability to execute in a remote startup environment\n• Curiosity, humility, a desire to learn and grow and to help others learn and grow\n• Passion for building thoughtful, ethical technology\n\nNice-to-haves, but not required:\n• Experience at an early stage startup\n• Experience with the current tech stack (described below)\n• Experience at a consumer social platform company or working with their APIs\n• Experience with trust and safety / moderation / anti-abuse\n\nTech stack:\nOur browser extension product, Privacy Party, is built in React.js and SCSS, with core automations primarily in JavaScript. The application backend is handled by a Python Flask service with a GraphQL API and persistent data backed by a Postgres database via SQLAlchemy/Alembic. Our cloud infrastructure is hosted on Render and AWS.\n\nThe application is integrated with Sentry and Mixpanel for error logging and product metrics, respectively. We use Parcel for static assets builds, TypeScript for type annotations / safety, Jest for frontend unit tests, and Storybook as a UI harness for frontend development. Additional build verification with continuous integration on CircleCI helps us ensure that we deliver a consistent user experience.\n\nNote: Although it is currently on hiatus due to Twitter API changes, we still have hopes of bringing back Block Party's original anti-harassment product for Twitter someday. The web UI for that product is similarly built in React.js and SCSS, served by Python Flask through a GraphQL API and backed by PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy/Alembic as the ORM. The bulk of the engineering work, though, is in systems to fetch and process large amounts of data from the Twitter API, the asynchronous task work implemented with Celery and backed by Redis and RabbitMQ. Everything is hosted on Render and AWS.\n\nDiversity and inclusion:\nAt Block Party, we believe in diversity and inclusion, and no applicant will face discrimination based on: race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, parental status, or veteran status.",

      "job_description": "Based in: UNITED STATES or Canada (Remote)\n\nPosition Summary\n\nAt HackerOne, we’re on a mission to empower the world to build a safer internet. We’re a growing engineering team with an outsized impact, and we’re looking for a Software Engineer to help us innovate and propel our platform forward. As Senior Software Engineer, you will work with your squad on a variety of challenging and exciting projects. You are a collaborative and effective software engineer as well as a team member. You will work with other engineers at many different levels to gain experience quickly and build delightful features and products for our community, as well as the thousands of companies who trust HackerOne with their cybersecurity posture.\n\nNo security engineering experience? Not a blocker.\n\nNo hacking experience? No problem.\n\nWe are first and foremost product engineers. Digging deep to our core, we are engineers who believe that skillsets are meant to be grown. We don’t need to seek unicorns because we grow into them. Your work will contribute directly to the success of our company, and we are excited to meet you!\n\nThis particular software engineering position will reside on a Payments Engineering Team. The Payments Engineering Team’s mission is to enable HackerOne to move money between customers and hackers in a compliant, flexible, and safe manner.\n\nYour Journey at HackerOne\n• For the first 30 days, you'll be onboarded onto our team, getting familiar with our tools, stack, mission, and most importantly your team. Exploration begins and doesn’t stop\n• By 60 days, you’ll have been eased into our wider ecosystem of rotations and tech leadership. You’ll have confidence to take on project work within the team\n• By 90 days you’ll have completed your first stint as a technical project lead and surprised you’ve only been here for 3 months!\n• At HackerOne we believe in dual engineering career paths. Management is a lateral move, not a promotion. We believe in the ability to explore both paths and -- more importantly -- change your mind if one or the other is not a right fit\n• As part of a small team that punches far above its weight, you’ll get to dive into new product innovation and interesting technical constraints that come with being in the security space, while balancing user delight and satisfaction\n• We’re big on ownership, so we embrace strong collaboration and the ability to influence how we do things\n\nWho You Are\n• 5+ years experience with building enterprise web applications; (Note: years in industry is a rough proxy for impact and experience. It’s not about how long you’ve been doing what you’re doing. It’s about what experience you bring to the table)\n• Experience with Ruby on Rails, relational databases, API design, and writing technical documentation\n• Successful track record of shipping projects quickly with multiple dependencies across technical and non-technical teams\n• Excellent team player with strong communication skills\n• Comfortable collaborating with stakeholders such as Finance and Compliance to understand requirements\n• Ability and willingness to consistently make culture choices that positively impact all of engineering\n• Experience in payment systems that include payout methods such as bank transfers, PayPal, and Bitcoin would be an asset but not essential\n• HackerOne is a digital first company, and all employees must be able to work and excel in a remote environment.\n\nEmployment at HackerOne is contingent on a background check.\n\nHackerOne is committed to equal opportunity in the terms and conditions of employment for all employees and job applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, gender identity or gender expression, national origin, pregnancy, disability or veteran status, or any other protected characteristic as outlined by international, federal, state, or local laws.\n\nThis policy applies to all HackerOne employment practices, including hiring, recruiting, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, leave of absence, compensation, benefits, training, and apprenticeship. HackerOne makes hiring decisions based solely on qualifications, merit, and business needs at the time.\n\nPursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, all qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records will be considered for the position.\n\nHackerOne Values\n\nHackerOne commits to maintaining a strong, inclusive culture built for our employees and our community of hackers. We are driven by our five core values. We recognize that our mission is bigger than us, and therefore act with integrity at all times. As a team, we believe that transparency builds trust so we default to disclosure in our communications. Each individual executes with excellence, creating an environment of greater alignment and greater autonomy. We win as a team and respect all people to empower everyone to learn from each other, innovate, and grow.\n\nWhat We Do\n\nHackerOne pinpoints the most critical security flaws across an organization’s attack surface with continual adversarial testing to outmatch cybercriminals. HackerOne’s Attack Resistance Platform blends the security expertise of ethical hackers with asset discovery, continuous assessment, and process enhancement to reduce threat exposure and empower organizations to transform their businesses with confidence. Customers include Citrix, Coinbase, Costa Coffee, General Motors, GitHub, Goldman Sachs, Hyatt, Microsoft, PayPal, Singapore’s Ministry of Defense, Slack, the U.S. Department of Defense, and Yahoo. In 2023, HackerOne was named a Best Workplace for Innovators by Fast Company.\n\nHackerOne is Digital First\n\nOur work is optimized for asynchronous collaboration, knowledge management, and decision-making. HackerOne is creating an industry, and to do that, we must employ the most creative, forward-thinking distributed talent in the market. Our remote model allows employees to contribute to our mission while providing time and location flexibility which are core elements to a healthy relationship between professional and personal pursuits.\n\n#LI-Remote\n\n#LI-HM1",

      "job_description": "About Us\n\nOne Medical is a primary care solution challenging the industry status quo by making quality care more affordable, accessible and enjoyable. But this isn't your average doctor's office. We're on a mission to transform healthcare, which means improving the experience for everyone involved - from patients and providers to employers and health networks. Our seamless in-office and 24/7 virtual care services, on-site labs, and programs for preventive care, chronic care management, common illnesses and mental health concerns have been delighting people for the past fifteen years.\n\nIn February 2023 we marked a milestone when One Medical joined Amazon. Together, we look to deliver exceptional health care to more consumers, employers, care team members, and health networks to achieve better health outcomes. As we continue to grow and seek to impact more lives, we're building a diverse, driven and empathetic team, while working hard to cultivate an environment where everyone can thrive.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nAt One Medical we build software to improve the healthcare experience for not just our members, but for our providers as well. This enables us to build amazing end-to-end solutions to connect patients and our care team in new and innovative ways.\n\nAs a Staff Software Engineer (Machine Learning), not only will you be partnering with designers and product managers, you'll also be working with clinicians and staff who deliver care daily to One Medical patients. You'll work across the healthcare lifecycle to build features that deliver higher quality care more efficiently and compassionately.\n\nThis role is particularly well-suited for someone who values having significant ownership of their work, helping to lead the direction of the team and/or partnering and mentoring other engineers. We tend to partner with other product teams to build solutions in their domains.\n\nWe are a collaborative and intellectually curious group.

If you buy into these ideologies, we'd love to find a time to connect.\n\nWhat you'll work on:\n• Augmenting the patient experience: When members ask questions or book appointments, we want to deliver exceptional patient experiences by providing timely support and assistance. You will utilize novel techniques such as deep learning to understand, support and enhance user interactions, and to create a seamless and accessible patient journey.\n• Enhancing clinical workflows: Our goal is to help our providers focus on doing what they do best: providing best-in-class patient care. We build tools that streamline encounters using predictive autocomplete, summarize and categorize documents, highlight patient risk areas, and provide clinical decision support.\n• Enabling population health management: Even when the patient is not in the clinician's office, we can analyze the health data of the population overall. We build tools to identify at-risk patients who can benefit from various screenings and preemptive interventions to keep members healthy.\n\nYou'll be set up for success if you have:\n• Proven experience and high-level of proficiency in Python and related packages.\n• Deep understanding of machine learning with 7+ years of experience\n• Deep understanding of LLM's. We focus on a wide variety of NLP use cases including writing assistance, summarization, and concept extraction.\n• Understanding of different metrics used in NLP\n• Familiarity with Amazon Web Services (AWS) or other cloud services\n• Track record of deploying machine learning services to production\n• A passion for learning, experimenting with, and applying cutting edge machine learning technologies\n\nNot required, but it would be great if you also had:\n• Knowledge of security best practices\n• Excellent communication skills to translate technical and business strategy in collaboration with partners (business leaders, product managers, clinical/operations staff) across the organization\n• Familiarity with Amazon Web Services (AWS) or other cloud services\n• Understanding of relational databases such as MySQL or Postgres, as well as NoSQL databases such as DynamoDB\n\nTaking care of you today:\n• Paid sabbatical after 5 and 10 years\n• Employee Assistance Program - Free, confidential advice for team members who need help with stress, anxiety, financial planning, and legal issues\n• Competitive Medical, Dental, and Vision plans\n• Free One Medical memberships for yourself, your friends, and your family\n• Pre-Tax commuter benefits\n• PTO cash outs - Option to cash out up to 40 accrued hours per year\n\nProtecting your future for you and your family:\n• 401k match\n• Opportunity to participate in company equity programs\n• Credit towards emergency childcare\n• Company-paid maternity and paternity leave\n• Paid Life Insurance - One Medical pays 100% of the cost of Basic Life Insurance\n• Disability Insurance - One Medical pays 100% of the cost of Short Term and Long Term Disability Insurance\n\nThis is a full-time remote role based in the United States. One Medical is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices. The base salary range for this role is $152,000 to $260,000 per year. Actual compensation packages are based on several factors that are unique to each candidate, including but not limited to skill set, depth of experience, certifications, and specific work location.

      "job_description": "About Nomos\n\nGenerative AI is quickly changing how humans and computers interact and will have a drastic and lasting impact on the productivity of humankind. For companies building technology using generative AI, the biggest bottleneck to their growth is often a lack of strategy and infrastructure for developing, iterating, and scaling their product; adopting new, unfamiliar computing platforms is incredibly challenging.\n\nWe have spent our careers building and scaling companies like Neeva, Robinhood, Plaid, Meta, Phantom, and Google, and we have seen this problem firsthand — builders and developers struggle to wrangle and work with stochastic AI systems in their products. This results in complex (often expensive) coordination between stakeholders and convoluted AI tooling, taking away valuable time and focus from their customers.\n\nAt Nomos, we set out to simplify and fix this. We're dedicated to empowering this transformation by building the tools and experiences to enable the new era of generative AI applications and their developers. We are a developer platform built from the ground up, offering builders and developers a generative AI first-principles solution that cuts the time to launch, reduces undesirable AI results, and ensures your generative AI application is best-in-class.\n\nCome build with us, and let's usher in the age of generative AI together!\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWe're a lean, experienced team looking to bring on another excellent software engineer. Most of our stack is written in TypeScript, and we generally prefer candidates with at least five years of production coding experience on high-caliber and high-velocity teams. You will partner with leadership to ensure that our development platform is truly best-in-class by driving features through inception, design, and execution and ultimately implementing the most critical projects that empower our customers to build the best generative AI products.\n\nWhat Excites You\n• A highly collaborative environment with a tight feedback loop between your work and its impact on our customers.\n• You have a passion for helping engineers grow and learn and are excited to improve engineering velocity for the team.\n• You have a vision for the systems you work on, but you know how to build incremental milestones and when to make trade-offs between completeness and utility to get to value fast.\n• You’re incredibly proud of the code you write and review and like staying close to the systems you own, and you advocate for high standards in code quality and code review processes.\n• You have a deep commitment to craft & product excellence, incredible design intuition, and an obsession with the customer and their experience.\n\nThe target base salary for this role is between $120,000 and $200,000 per year. The anticipated base salary range excludes full benefits, including equity, health care insurance, time off, etc. This base salary is accurate based on information at the time of posting. Actual compensation for hired candidates will be determined using several factors, including experience, skills, and qualifications.\n\nNomos is committed to working with the best and brightest people from the broadest talent pool possible. We value bringing together a team with different perspectives, educational backgrounds, and life experiences, and a diversity of ideas allows us to develop the best solutions. All qualified individuals are encouraged to apply.\n\nIf you need assistance or reasonable accommodation during the application and recruiting process, don't hesitate to contact accommodations@getnomos.com.",

With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals (faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of ~70 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.\n\nOur backend tech stack currently consists primarily of Python Flask web apps with our TaskTiger scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like EKS, MSK, RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented public API that our front-end JavaScript app consumes. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using Terraform, Ansible and other AWS tools.\n\nWe open sourcing our code and ideas on our GitHub and onThe Making of Close, our behind-the-scenes Product & Engineering blog.

We trust you’re an adult and know best how to prioritize, meet your goals and contribute at a high level.\n• Asynchronous communication & collaboration: We have team members all over the world. We don’t expect anyone to work untraditional hours, that means our default is async.

We’re a collection of talented humans, rich in diverse backgrounds, lifestyles, and cultures. Every year we meet up somewhere around the world to spend time with one another. These gatherings are an opportunity to strengthen the relationships within our global community.\n\nOur team is growing in more ways than one - in the last few years, we've launched 24 babies (and counting!). Unanimously, our favorite and most impactful value is “Build a house you want to live in.” We strive to make decisions that are authentic for our people and help our customers become more successful.\n\nOur application process was designed to promote equitable and unbiased hiring practices. We ask a small series of questions that are similar to what would be asked in the first interview. This helps us learn more about you right from the start so please be sure to answer each question thoughtfully. Each application will receive two screens by two different reviewers. Regardless of fit, you will hear back from us letting you know if we'll be moving forward.",

We give developers and ops teams two-way, real-time sync, so they can build production-ready workflows.\n\nWhalesync launched during Y Combinator’s S21 cohort. Since then we’ve raised $4M from some of the world’s top investors. We’re now trusted by hundreds of companies like Ramp, Webflow, and Alchemy, and process millions of transactions every day. Many of our customers enjoy the product so much they tell all their friends.\n\nWhat we value\n• We’re always shipping - fast, scrappy people thrive here.\n• We’re obsessed with goals - we’re here to turn a small startup into a long-lasting company.\n• We start with the customer - we all talk to users and work backward from their problems.\n• We have an outlier output bar - we’re an intentionally small, highly effective team.\n\nWhat we’re looking for\n\nReal-time, bi-directional data syncing across an infinite number of tools is a hard technical problem. Offering this in a way that’s simple and accessible is an equally hard design problem.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who is excited by this challenge and the potential impact we can make if we do this right. You’re a product-minded engineer who thrives in a highly autonomous environment. Shipping fast and building awesome things brings you joy.\n\nWhat you’ll be doing\n\nStartups have 70+ SaaS tools on average… data integration is a problem that isn’t going away.

You’ll have full ownership of projects and work closely with our customers. More specifically, you will:\n• Build many core functionalities that make Whalesync the most powerful data automation tool (e.g. data merging, sync rollbacks, scaling to millions of records, etc.)\n• Build many core features that make Whalesync simple and accessible for both developers and non-developers (e.g. sync previews, auto-schema creation, data visualization, etc.)\n• Work directly with our customers to help solve their problems\n• Ship a bunch of code!\n\nOur stack\n• AWS Fargate\n• NestJS backend\n• Next.js frontend\n• Postgres and Redis data stores\n\nOutcomes we’ll achieve\n\nWe’re obsessed with goals. We make ambitious plans and then get creative in order to achieve them. These are some of the goals we’re focused on right now that we’re excited to reach together.\n• Go from hundreds to thousands of happy customers\n• Cut the time it takes to onboard in half\n• Raise the ceiling of the product by making it more flexible\n• Scale our backend from tens of millions to billions of rows of data\n• Add even more large, fast-growing customers (like Ramp, Webflow, Anrok, Alchemy, etc.)\n• Continue to grow MRR rapidly and raise a series A\n\nRequirements\n• High ownership and autonomy\n• Strong product sense\n• Clear verbal and written communicator\n• Proven ability to drive big projects to completion\n• Strong technical grasp and excellent judgment on task prioritizations\n\nNice-to-have\n• Previously a founder\n• You’ve worked in an early-stage, high-growth SaaS company\n• TypeScript experience\n• Infrastructure and/or data pipeline experience\n\nInterview Process\n\nHere’s a quick overview of our process.\nBenefits\n• Competitive salary and meaningful equity\n• 100% remote\n• Meeting-light culture\n• Three weeks PTO in addition to holidays and sick days\n• Top-tier health, dental, and vision insurance\n• 401k contributions\n• Latest productivity software such as Notion, Linear, and Superhuman",

      "job_description": "Figma is growing our team of passionate people on a mission to make design accessible to all. Born on the Web, Figma helps entire product teams brainstorm, create, test, and ship better designs, together. From great products to long-lasting companies, we believe that nothing great is made alone—come make with us!\n\nFigJam is an online whiteboard for teams to ideate and brainstorm together. Purpose-built for every stage of your end-to-end workflows, FigJam makes everything from whiteboarding to design sprints easier and more fun — whether you’re working alone or collaborating with your extended team, no matter where in the world they’re based.\n\nThis is Figma’s newest standalone product offering and is still in its earliest stages of opportunity; we’ll look to you to help own and shape product direction as we explore this greenfield space. You’ll use our unique technical stack to solve complex technical challenges and help launch some of FigJam’s most compelling forthcoming features.\n\nWe use C++ (we call it fullscreen) for the main canvas working space in FigJam, which compiles to WebAssembly to run in the browser and enables our powerful performance and rendering capability - an industry setting standard for what is possible on the web. We use React and Typescript for our UI, where things like our toolbar and context menus live; it works in close concert with the WebAssembly layer, so we can offer a responsive, interactive, and delightful user experience. Livegraph is Figma’s own implementation of GraphQL, which helps us query data from our databases efficiently. We occasionally dabble in REST APIs and our infrastructure code as well!\n\nProfessional experience with these languages and technologies is not a requirement. We encourage candidates to use the programming language that they’re most comfortable with during interviews—new hires will be onboarded onto our codebase on the job.\n\nFigma is a highly collaborative organization and most projects are owned by small teams of 2-3 people. You’ll form strong relationships and collaborate with engineers outside of your immediate team, designers, leaders, PMs, data scientists, and user researchers to both scale our product efforts and invest in each other’s learning, growth, and success. We strive to foster an inclusive culture that promotes equity and belonging, and use our engineering values to guide how we work together: communicate early and often, lift your team, focus on craftsmanship, and prioritize impact. Learn more about our values and how we developed them here.\n\nThis is a full-time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.\n\nWhat you’ll do at Figma:\n\nIn 30 days, you will…\n• Be paired with an onboarding buddy on your team who will help you ramp in our stack and get to know Figma. You’ll move from starter tasks and codebase contributions aligned to your existing experience to areas that present growth opportunities and learning.\n• Begin contributing to feature workstreams organized around weekly roadmap goals and longer-term milestones in partnership with engineers and designers - we don’t operate in silos.\n• Get to know Figmates across the company via team-building activities (like our weekly Zoom hang, where we celebrate wins, play games, and have even made literal, delicious fig jam together), participating in our Give a Fig philanthropy efforts, joining one of our Employee Resource Groups, or creating something amazing during Maker Week.\n\nIn 60 days, you will…\n• Ship a feature to production, which might include things like a UX update to our delightful toolbar.\n• Participate in design reviews, technical reviews, and give feedback during user testing sessions.\n• Craft performance objectives with your manager that align with company priorities and career development opportunities.\n\nIn 90 days (and beyond), you will…\n• Work closely with cross-functional partners to drive a new feature from conception to execution to shipping, like Open Sessions, which allows users to join your FigJam files for up to 24 hours at a time without log-ins or friction.\n• Contribute to org-wide initiatives like new hire onboarding, developing interview processes, and Diversity, Equity, and Belonging efforts.\n• Improve engineering processes around testing, reliability, and quality.\n• Be a mentor and provide thoughtful feedback to your peers, and benefit from strong personal and professional mentorship opportunities yourself.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you if you have:\n• At least 3+ years* of professional experience shipping features or products as a fullstack developer, ideally in one of our core technical domains (but not required!)\n• Working on or leading development on a large web application.\n• Writing C++ (or related languages such as Objective C or C) in a user-facing context (e.g. gaming, native applications).\n• Proactive communication skills and a willingness to work directly with designers, product managers, and other collaborators to build performant, fun, accessible experiences for users.\n• Experience in and a desire to teach fellow engineers through pairing, code review, and in-the-moment feedback.\n• A dedication to building a supportive and inclusive environment with and for your teammates.\n\nOne of Figma’s values is to Grow as you go. We believe in hiring smart, curious people who are excited to learn and develop their skills. If you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with the points outlined in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles!\n\nWe will work to ensure individuals with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodation to participate in the interview process, to perform essential job functions, and to receive other benefits and privileges of employment. Please let your recruiter know if you require accommodation.\n\nRead more about our team:\n• Investing in Figma: The Decade of Design\n• How work is changing at Figma\n• Figma's next product is a multiplayer whiteboard called FigJam\n• Software Design Startup Figma Is Now Worth $10 Billion\n• Inside Figma: How Figma Engineering uses FigJam to scale\n• Inside Figma: How our PM team uses FigJam\n• Jamming on FigJam: A journey from beta to GA\n\nPay Transparency Disclosure\n\nIf based in Figma’s San Francisco or New York hub offices, this role has the annual base salary range stated below.\n\nJob level and actual compensation will be decided based on factors including, but not limited to, individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process (including skills and prior relevant experience, potential impact, and scope of role), market demands, and specific work location. The listed range is a guideline, and the range for this role may be modified. For roles that are available to be filled remotely, the pay range is localized according to employee work location by a factor of between 80% and 100% of range. Please discuss your specific work location with your recruiter for more information.\n\nFigma offers equity to employees, as well a competitive package of additional benefits, including health, dental & vision, retirement with company contribution, parental leave & reproductive or family planning support, mental health & wellness benefits, generous PTO, company recharge days, a learning & development stipend, a work from home stipend, and cell phone reimbursement. Figma also offers sales incentive pay for most sales roles. Figma’s compensation and benefits are subject to change and may be modified in the future.\n\nAnnual Base Salary Range (SF/NY Hub):\n\n$168,000—$350,000 USD\n\nAbout Figma\n\nDylan Field and Evan Wallace co-founded Figma in 2012 with the vision of building tools for designers in the browser. Their goal was to create the first design tool that combined the accessibility of the Web with the functionality of a native app. Today Figma is a platform with tools and spaces to support the entire product development process—idea to design to build—and has simplified collaboration for companies like Microsoft, Uber, and The New York Times to name a few.\n\nAt Figma, we celebrate and support our differences. We know employing a team rich in diverse backgrounds, experiences, and opinions allows our employees, products, and community to flourish. Figma is an equal opportunity workplace—we are dedicated to equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity, or veteran status. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements.\n\nWe will work to ensure individuals with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodation to participate in the interview process, to perform essential job functions, and to receive other benefits and privileges of employment. Please let your recruiter know if you require accommodation.\n\nBy applying for this job, the candidate acknowledges and agrees that any personal data contained in their application or supporting materials will be processed in accordance with the applicable candidate section of Figma's Privacy Policy.",
